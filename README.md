## Solution
The solution is based on using the Django REST Framework as a backend, allauth for user authentication and profiling and a custom build application used for the frontend.

The flow is as follows:
User login or signup --> User adds a business or continues to request a loan --> User requests a loan --> User gets information on her or his loan, past loans and business
All the information can be accessed through the admin site
